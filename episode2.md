# What Is Sleep Really For? 

sleep:  
- outside sensory experience in most cases can't really impact us
- it resets our ability to be focused alert and emotionally stable in the wakeful period


# Sleep Hunger

quality of our sleep and wakeful state governed by two forces
1. adenosine (a chemical force ) : a molecule in our nervous system and body
    - builds up the longer we are awake
    - creates a sort of sleep drive or a sleep hunger
2. circadian force
  
caffeine for most people except a very small percentage of people wakes them up
- acts as an adenosine antagonist : that means when you ingest caffeine it binds to the adenosine receptor -> it sort of parks there so adenosine can't park in -> receptor can't engage the normal cellular functions of making you sleepy -> it blocks the sleepiness receptor


# Caffeine: Devil & Angel

caffeine tolerance (fall sleep easily and get good sleep) and times of day you can tolerate it depends on:
- genetic variation , adenosine and these adenosine receptors
- find out experimentally

caffeine:
- increases dopamine which make us feel good and motivated
- give us energy because of epinephrine which is made from dopamine

# Timing Your Sleep Properly

if you've ever pulled an all-nighter as morning rolls around you'll suddenly feel an increase in your energy and alertness even though adenosine has been building the entire night -> circadian force

circadian (about a day) force : inside of our brains is  a clock that determines when we want to be and when we want to be awake.

The block of sleep and when it falls within each 24-hour cycle is governed by a number of different things:
- the most powerful thing is light

# Release Your Hormones (At The Right Times)

most people tend to wake up sometime around the sun rises :
- adenosine levels tend to be low
- our system generates an internal signal in form of hormones
  - hormone : a chemical that's released from one organ in your body and goes and acts on other organs including nervous system
  - when we wake up a particular hormone called cortisol is released from  adrenal glands (right above kidney)
  - also release of epinephrine which is adrenaline from your adrenals and also in brain
    - alert  whole system and body, increase heart rate, start tensing muscles 

it's very important that that cortisol pulse come in early day  
cortisol is related to stress -> different stressors during day  

when we wake up in the morning and experience that rise in cortisol
- there's a timer that starts going and dictate when a different hormone called melatonin will be secreted
  

# (Pineal) Melatonin Warning
cellular timer which dictated by the relation between different organs says to to the brain and body in about 12 to 14 hours melatonin will be released from your pineal gland.  

there's two mechanisms:
1. wakefulness signal
   - signal triggers the onset of the timer for the sleepiness signal
2. sleepiness signal (melatonin)
   
melatonin:
- makes sleepy and let us sleep
- comes only from the pineal
- unless exogenous melatonin(Supplements)

the pineal gland:
- near the fourth ventricle
- size of pine
- descarte (philosopher): `pineal was the seat of the soul`

should i take melatonin ? my personal bias (buberman)
- is except in rare cases no
- because: melatonin has a second function
  - suppresses the onset of puberty
    - in kids and especially in babies is also released chronically or tonically throughout the day and night to suppress some of the other hormones in the brain that trigger the onset of puberty 
  - melatonin will help you fall asleep but it won't help you stay asleep and you may wake up 3-5 hours after taking it and  unable to fall back sleep
    - commercially available melatonin is completely unregulated (amount)

the rhythm of cortisol and melatonin is endogenous = happening in us all the  time without any external input (both hormonal neural)  
these endogenous system of body were set so that external things could govern when they happen
- one particular sensory event -> one particular influence on the nervous system -> determines when that cortisol is going to start to rise

# Strange Vision Is Good Vision 

retina cells are just the one piece of the brain  
when light comes into the eye -> particular type of retinal ganglion cells -> perceives a particular type of light -> communicates  to the clock that resides right above the roof of your mouth (suprachiasmatic nucleu) -> suprachiasmatic nucleus has connections with essentially every cell and organ of the body

if you don't get your cortisol and melatonin rhythms right -> tremendously broad and bad effects on cardiovascular health dementia metabolic effects (learning depression dementia)

these neurons in our eye:
- set the circadian clock and then allow our circadian clock to set all the clocks of all the cells and organs and tissues of our body
- responds best to a particular quality of light an amount of light
  - light that come from sunlight
  - when the sun is low in the sky -> there's a particular contrast between yellows and blues -> triggers the activation of these cell
  - artificial lights is not optimal for the activation
  
it's 50 times less effective to view this sunlight through a window through a car windshield or through a side window of a car than it is to just get  outside with no sunglasses

a late shifted cortisol pulse in particular 9 p.m or 8 p.m increase in cortisol
- is one of the consequences and maybe one of the causes of a lot of anxiety 
disorders and depression (correlated)

bringing that cortisol pulse earlier in wakeful period earlier in your day has 
positive benefits (far away from your melatonin pulse)

how long should you be outside ?
- vary tremendously
  - 30 to 60 seconds in very bright place
  - go outside for longer even if there's a lot of dense cloud (getting 10 000 to 50 000 lux)

early in the day your retina is not very sensitive -> you need a lot of photons
ideally coming from sunlight to set these clock mechanisms not from artificial lights
- if you can't see sunlight -> use an artificial light that either simulates sunlight or has a lot of blue light
  
# Blue Light Is Great! 
we really want a lot of blue and yellow light arriving on the retina early in the day particularly coming from sunlight

wearing blue blockers is the exact wrong throughout the day and should be reserved for late in the evening:
- because light suppresses melatonin
- sunlight inhibits the pineal it prevents it from releasing melatonin

the pineal is the gland of darkness:
- melatonin can be thought of as a sleepiness signal that's correlated with 
darkness

get up each morning try and get outside : 2 to 10 mins sunlight exposure 
is going to work well for most people -> do it on a regular basis
- you don't have to do it exactly at sunrise
- if you can't get it from sunlight get it from artificial light -> sunlight 
sunrise simulators

the ring lights that people use for selfies generate a lot of blue light.  
light meter : app to measure the amount of photon energy 
- the outside light is scattered in the atmosphere - has more photon energy even when you think that you're not getting much sunlight
- the artificial light is very condensed

hormone systems and neurotransmitter systems that make us awake at certain periods of the day and sleepy at other times are operating by averaging when we view the brightest light


# The Real Problem With Smartphones 
waking up and looking at the phones which isn't triggering activation of these 
cells in the eye and the central circadian clock is terrible

never ever ever compromise safety (prescription lenses and sunglasses)

# Blind / Low Vision People 

low vision and blind people who the eyes weren't removed
- still maintain melanopsin ganglion cells
- it's not about seeing and perceiving the sun
- this is a subconscious mechanism by these cells
- these cells set the circadian clock by getting activated by the particular 
wavelengths of light that are present in the atmosphere even coming through  cloud 
cover
some night owls -> having genetic polymorphism for stay up late and wake up 
late  
but most night owls are just not getting enough sunlight early in the day


# Using Exercise & Food To Set Your Clock
circadian health :rhythm of cortisol followed by melatonin 12 to 16 hours later

viewing light early in the day is foundation of circadian health (primary zeitgeber [the time giver])  
other factors:
- timing of food intake
- timing of exercise
- various drugs or chemicals

melanopsin ganglion cells:
- are the main way (input) and the only direct way to set the clock
- aren't important for sight like pattern vision

particular sunlight is a thousand to ten thousand times more effective than getting up in darkness and just exercising

intergeniculate  leaflet: 
- the structure which sits a few millimeters away in the brain
- involved in regulating the clock output through  non-photic non-light type influences :
  - exercise
  - feeding
  - ...
# The Power of Sunset
what sets the clock and keeps it anchored:
- bright light early in the day
- sunset : the sun is also at low solar angle low close to the horizon

viewing sunlight around the time of sunset prevents some of the bad effects of 
light in preventing melatonin release later that same night
- the best thing to do is just to get outside from two to ten minute in the afternoon

these two signals arriving to your central clock that your body your internal world knows when it's morning and when it's evening is tremendously powerful

# The Healthy Holes In Your Skull 
every cell and organ in the body needs:
- light information and the only way to get that light information is by viewing sunlight with your eyes at the two times a day
- because inside of us is dark
- no extraocular photoreception in humans
- but in some animals like snakes there is a hole in the top of their skull to get light information directly to their pineal


# Bad Light 
the longer you've been awake the more sensitive your retina and these cells are to light

if you've been awake for 10 to 14 hours it becomes very easy for even a small amount of light coming from a screen or from an overhead light to trigger the activation of the clock and make you feel like you want to stay up later make it harder to fall asleep and disrupt your sleep pattern

- as much light as as safely possible early in the day morning and throughout 
the day including blue light
- as little light coming into your eyes artificial or sunlight after say 8 pm
- certainly you do not want to get bright light exposure to your eyes between 11 pm and 4 am
  - light that arrives to the eyes between 11 pm and 4 am approximately 
suppresses the release of dopamine (feel good - as an endogenous anti-depressant)
  - can inhibit learning and create all sorts of other detrimental effects 
  - the neural pathways that involves light to the eyes ->  signal to a structure called the habenula -> habenula gets activated
    - habenula : a pair of small nuclei  in part of the thalamus
    - habenula called the disappointment nucleus 
      - it actually makes us feel less happy and more disappointed
      - can lead to certain forms of depression in in the wakeful state
# Light Location

red light won't trigger this pathway  
very few people have the kind of infrared lights that are set up or floor lights

melanopsin ganglion cells reside mostly not exclusively but mostly in the bottom half of our retina
- these cells are actually viewing our upper visual field (essentially designed to detect sunlight)
- in the evening : place lights low in your physical environment (desktop or floor)
  - overhead fluorescent lights is worst
  - overhead sort of yellow or reddish tints is slightly better
  - dim lights that are set low in the room are the best


# Fire / Candlelight
some people turn their home basically into a cave in the evenings

candle light , fireplaces and campfires :
- fine dim lights
- does not trigger activation of these cells

# When To Eat 

the literature around nutrition:
- it's best to restrict your feeding to a certain period of each 24-hour cycle

# How To Wake Up Earlier 

if you turn on the lights around 45 minutes to an hour before waking up -> even your eyelids are closed (not under covers) -> after doing that for a few days -> increases your total sleep time & shifts forward the time at which you 
feel sleepy & it makes you want to go to bed earlier each night


we have the capacity for :
- phase advances
  1. if you see light late in the day and in particular in the middle of the night
  2. your brain and body think that that's morning light even though it's not sunlight (because heightened sensitivity)
  3. phase delay will delay your clock
  4. make you want to get up later and go to sleep later
- phase delays
  1. if you wake up early and get light exposure (6 a.m or 7 a.m)
  2. phase advance advance the clock
  3. make your clock think it's earlier and to wake up earlier

provide consistent powerful light anchors so that your cortisol your melatonin -> all the stuff(metabolism, learning, ...) is timed regularly
- early in the day and in the evening and avoiding light at night

naps:
- less than one ultradian cycle
- 20 minutes or 30 minutes or even 1 hour
- because: around two or three or four in the afternoon there's a spike in in everything from alertness to ability to learn some metabolic

some people they wake up from naps feeling really groggy:
- probably because : 
    1. not sleeping as well as or as long as they should at night 
    2. they're dropping into rem sleep or deeper forms of sleep in the daytime
    3. feel kind of disoriented

nap just like with caffeine we sort of have to evaluate for ourselves ( good   for some people not for others)  
but light viewing behavior at regular intervals in circadian system hardwired into our system the same way we could factually say that everybody needs

yoga nidra (yoga sleep) :
- it's a sort of meditation that you listen to
- consciously bring your entire body and mind into a state of deep relaxation
- sometimes you fall asleep
- 10 to 30 or even 60 minutes

yoga nidra or more standard forms of meditation
- bring our mind into a state of less so-called sympathetic nervous system activation
- governs your alertness
- activates cells and circuits in your body that promote the parasympathetic nervous system or the calming system
- helpful in terms of accelerating the transition to sleep at night

there is a certain form of hypnosis for sleep
- take the brain into states of deep relaxation

best time of day for yoga nidra , mediation ,...
- first wake up in the morning
- anytime you wake up in the middle of the night
- any time of day!!!

there's a sort of asymmetry to the way our autonomic nervous system (alertness calmness)
- more easily able to engage wakefulness and force ourselves to stay awake than force to fall asleep
- it's very hard to control the mind with the mind
- mechanism that involves the body help fo fall asleep
  - meditation hypnosis yoga : all involve
    - exhale emphasize breathing
    - certain ways of lying down
    - controlling the body

# Using The Body To Control The Mind

we're having trouble controlling the mind, use body:
- some of the things like sensation perception etc
- look toward sunlight avoid bright light in late night
- breathing
  
the meditation practice  are really teaching you to use your body to control your mind and to allow you to explore the mind-body relationship in a way 
that gives you more control over your mind 

non-sleep deep rest (NSDR):
- includes naps, meditation yoga nidra, hypnosis ,...
- reset one's ability to be awake after you emerge from it
- more wakefulness and emotional stability
- make easier to fall asleep when you want to go to sleep at night
  - one study shows NSDRs allows dopamine and other neuromodulators in the (striatum) to reset itself
    - striatum: an area of the brain involved in motor planning and motor execution
  - reset our ability to engage in the world in a way that's very deliberate  engage in (engage in dpos (duration path and outcome))
  - NSDR is so powerful:
    - it doesn't require 
      - any device 
      - much time out of your day, 
      -  ingest anything except air
   - have so many positive effects right down to
 - will play a more prominent role in mental health and physical health

the neuromodulator level
# Drugs & Supplements

Adderall:
- have an addictive potential
- some other quite bad effects 

safe supplements in case of having trouble with sleep (for better falling and 
staying asleep)
- magnesium : 
  - best form : Magnesium L-Threonate
    - associated with transporters in the body that bring more of it into cells
  - increasing neurotransmitters like gaba -> turn off the dpo (the kind of thinking about the future duration path outcome analysis)
  - mind kind of drift in space and time
  - huberman personal use: 300-400 mg , 30-60 mins before sleep
- theanine:
  - huberman personal use: 100-200 mg , 30-60 mins before sleep
  - theanine is used in  energy drinks to take away the jitters
  - energy drinks are can be problematic
- Apigenin:
  - is a derivative of chamomile
  - huberman personal use: 50 milligrams

theanine and magnesium together can make some people  so sleepy and sleep so deeply that they actually have trouble waking up in the morning 
- you have to play with these things and titrate them 
# Sleep Walking
theanine can often make the dreams very vivid
- sleepwalkers and people with very vivid dreams
  
apogenin is a fairly potent estrogen inhibitor
- avoid : women who want to keep their estrogen levels high
- take that into consideration : for men
